# Agile Development Process

In developing "You Matter," I have used an Agile methodology, specifically employing the Kanban board feature in GitHub. This approach allows to:

- **Highlight Must-Haves, Could-Haves, and More**: Clearly categorise and prioritise tasks and features based on their importance and impact.
- **Track Progress**: Continuously monitor the project's development and adjust priorities as needed.
- **Add Issues on the Go**: Dynamically create and manage issues as they arise, ensuring that all aspects of the project are addressed in a timely manner.
- **User Story Statements**: Each issue includes a user story statement to clarify the goal and context, ensuring that all team members have a shared understanding of the task at hand.

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/solracnauj92/youmatterproject4/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialised tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

![board](Documentation/userstory.png) 

## GitHub Issues

## User Persona

In this section, I utilized [UserPersona.dev](https://userpersona.dev) free AI-powered User Persona Generator. By providing a concise description, it generates insightful user personas. The narratives presented below are inspired by real-life struggles, with due consideration given to privacy and protection through the alteration of names, locations, images, and ages. The images were sourced from [Canva](https://canva.com), and I have ensured to resize and remove backgrounds to match the style of the website.

- Story 1: Sarah (Teenager)

![Sarah](static/images/sarah.jpg) 

Sarah is a 17-year-old high school student who has been struggling with social anxiety. She often felt isolated and overwhelmed in crowded social situations, which affected her academic performance and overall well-being. One day, she stumbled upon the "You Matter" website, where she found articles and self-help resources specifically tailored to teenagers facing similar challenges. She joined a support group and gradually built the confidence to share her experiences. Through the encouragement and guidance of the group, Sarah learned strategies to manage her anxiety and discovered that she wasn't alone in her struggles. Today, Sarah is thriving in school and is excited about the future, thanks to the support and resources she found on the website.

- Story 2: Michael (Working Professional)

![Micheal](static/images/michael.jpg) 

Michael, a 35-year-old working professional, had been dealing with work-related stress, anxiety, and burnout for years. He felt overwhelmed and on the brink of quitting his job. After a particularly tough week, he decided to search for mental health support online and came across the "You Matter" website. The resources on stress management, work-life balance, and burnout prevention resonated with him. He started using the self-assessment tools and strategies provided, which helped him regain control over his mental health. Michael also found an online support group for professionals in similar situations. With the support and insights he gained from the community, he made significant changes in his life and career, ultimately finding a better work-life balance and improved mental well-being.

- Story 3: Margaret (Retired Senior)

![Margaret](static/images/margaret.jpg) 

Margaret, an 80-year-old retiree, had been feeling increasingly lonely and anxious after losing her spouse and dealing with the challenges of aging. She discovered the "You Matter" website through her grandson and found a wealth of resources tailored to seniors facing mental health issues. The website provided information on coping with grief and isolation and tips for maintaining emotional well-being in later life. Margaret also joined an online seniors' support group where she met fellow retirees facing similar challenges. The connections she made and the compassionate discussions helped her combat her feelings of loneliness and find joy in her golden years. Margaret's experience demonstrates that it's never too late to seek support and that "You Matter" is there for people of all ages.

# Design 

## Wireframes

### Desktop Wireframe 

The desktop wireframe design created on Canva has played a important role in shaping the direction of this project. It serves as the foundational blueprint that embodies the complete vision of the web page layout. 
By visualising the page in its entirety on a larger screen, the desktop version provides a comprehensive view of the project's concept.


![wireframe_desktop](Documentation/desktop_wireframe.jpg) 
![wireframe_desktop_forms](Documentation/desktop_wireframe_forms.jpg) 

While the desktop wireframe showcases the full concept of the page, the next steps involve translating this design to tablet and mobile formats. These adaptations will ensure that the page remains responsive and user-friendly across different devices. Users will seamlessly scroll down to explore additional content, maintaining a cohesive experience.

#### Tablet Wireframe
![wireframe_tablet](Documentation/tablet_wireframe.jpg) 


#### Mobile Wireframe
![wireframe_mobile](Documentation/mobile_wireframe.jpg)

<br>

## Logo Design

Designed using Canva, the logo features:

- **Human Face Outline**: Represents the individuality and personal nature of mental health journeys.
- **Tornado-like Spiral in the Brain**: Symbolises the complexity and whirlwind of emotions and thoughts associated with mental health.

Initially, the spiral was red, but considering that red can evoke strong emotions that might not align with a calming and supportive environment, I updated the logo to use a more neutral and soothing grey.

![logo-design-process](Documentation/logo_design_process.jpg) 


## Colour Palette 

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/a6a6a6-e0e0e0-ffffff-004aad-38b6ff-c2d8e5) to generate my colour palette. The inspiration for this color scheme comes from my work in the mental health department at the NHS, where the use of blue is prevalent in creating a reassuring and professional atmosphere.

![colour](Documentation/colour.png) 


## Typography

### Font Import

To ensure consistent typography throughout the project, I've integrated the Questrial font from Google Fonts. This modern and sleek typeface enhances readability and visual appeal across different screen sizes.
Dedigned by Joe Prince and Laura Meseguer. As of June 2024, these fonts are licensed under the Open Font License. You can use them in your products & projects – print or digital, commercial or otherwise.

## Key Features 

![Key Features](Documentation/key_features.jpg) 

### Purpose
The Key Features section is strategically placed to help users quickly understand the purpose of the page, what they can find on it, and what to expect. This enhances the user experience by providing clear and concise information at a glance.

### Design
The Key Features section on the Home, Story, and Connect pages was designed using resources from [Bootstrap Brain](https://bootstrapbrain.com/component/bootstrap-5-services-section-design-example/#code) and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

#### Bootstrap Brain
I used a service section design example from Bootstrap Brain as the base for our Key Features section. This provided a solid, responsive foundation with modern design elements.

#### Bootstrap Icons
To enhance the visual appeal, I incorporated icons from the Bootstrap Icons library. Bootstrap Icons is a free, high-quality, open-source icon library with over 2,000 icons. These icons can be included as SVGs, SVG sprites, or web fonts, and can be used with or without Bootstrap in any project.

#### Custom Modifications
I then modified the base design and icons to fit our specific needs. The customisation included:
- Adjusting the layout and styling to match the overall theme of our website.

## Call-to-Action Hyperlinks Section

![Call To Action](Documentation/call_to_action_features.jpg)

# Guidance

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://youmatterproject4-4051e707d991.herokuapp.com/).

## PostgreSQL Database

This project uses a [Code Institute PostgreSQL Database](https://dbs.ci-dbs.net).

To obtain my own Postgres Database from Code Institute, I followed these steps:

- Signed-in to the CI LMS using my email address.
- An email was sent to me with my new Postgres Database.

> [!CAUTION]  
> - PostgreSQL databases by Code Institute are only available to CI Students.
> - You must acquire your own PostgreSQL database through some other method
> if you plan to clone/fork this repository.
> - Code Institute students are allowed a maximum of 8 databases.
> - Databases are subject to deletion after 18 months.

## Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

## Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs three additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile
- runtime.txt

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

The **runtime.txt** file needs to know which Python version you're using:
1. type: `python3 --version` in the terminal.
2. in the **runtime.txt** file, add your Python version:
	- `python-3.9.19`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

## Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This is a sample only; you would replace the values with your own if cloning/forking my repository.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`

### Cloning

You can clone the repository by following these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/solracnauj92/youmatterproject4) 
2. Locate the Code button above the list of files and click it 
3. Select if you prefer to clone using HTTPS, SSH, or GitHub CLI and click the copy button to copy the URL to your clipboard
4. Open Git Bash or Terminal
5. Change the current working directory to the one where you want the cloned directory
6. In your IDE Terminal, type the following command to clone my repository:
	- `git clone https://github.com/solracnauj92/youmatterproject4.git`
7. Press Enter to create your local clone.

Alternatively, if using Gitpod, you can click below to create your own workspace using this repository.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/solracnauj92/youmatterproject4)

Please note that in order to directly open the project in Gitpod, you need to have the browser extension installed.
A tutorial on how to do that can be found [here](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/user-settings/browser-extension).

### Forking

By forking the GitHub Repository, we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original owner's repository.
You can fork this repository by using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/solracnauj92/youmatterproject4)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. Once clicked, you should now have a copy of the original repository in your own GitHub account!
